# MATLAB-Truss-FEA
This is a repository containing my CIVE50003 Second term coursework, which consists of creating a truss bridge class to solve for influence lines within truss elements. This is the bridge in question:

The bridge experiences a point load of magnitude 2 MN that traverses its road nodes, which emulates the load of a travelling train. For more details, see the Contents commment in the [BRIDGE class](code/BRIDGE.m) file and the [coursework PDF](FEA-bridge-coursework.pdf). All plots and some calculations were executed using the [plot file](code/plotfile.m), note that you must have the [BRIDGE class](code/BRIDGE.m) to be able to run the plot file.
